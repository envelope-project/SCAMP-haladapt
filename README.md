# SCAMP-haladapt

Simple port of GPU [SCAMP](https://github.com/zpzim/SCAMP), a scalable matrix profile calculation algorithm, using the task-based programming model [HALadapt](https://capp.itec.kit.edu/research/?lang=e). 

## Requirements

- Latest HALadapt version
- CUDA toolkit, our code is tested with CUDA 10.1
- gflags
- Latest protobuf
- cmake 3
- gcc-7+

## Authors 
The original SCAMP Algorithm and GPU SCAMP is developed by the UCR Matrix Profile team at [University of California, Riverside](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/MatrixProfile.html). 
Adaptations for HALadapt is joint developed at 
- Chair of Computer Architecure and Parallel Systems at [Techincal University of Munich](www.caps.in.tum.de) by Yannick Schaelow, Amir Raoofy, and Dai Yang, and
- Chair of Computer Architecture and Parallel Processing at [Karlsruhe Institute of Technology](www.capp.itec.kit.edu) by Thomas Becker.
